# Context: Sharp Timer

## Current Focus
The project has just completed the `002-enhancements` feature set, bringing the application to version 1.1.0. All planned features, including timer state persistence, a quit confirmation dialog, enhanced audio notifications, and automatic mode switching, are fully implemented and tested.

## Recent Changes
- **Full Feature Implementation**: All features from the MVP (v1.0.0) and the recent enhancements (v1.1.0) are complete.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: A full test suite using pytest has been established, achieving over 90% code coverage.
- **Documentation**: User and developer documentation, including specification documents, is complete and up-to-date.
- **Performance**: The application meets all performance benchmarks for CPU usage, memory footprint, and response time.

## Next Steps
The project is currently in a stable, production-ready state. The immediate next steps would be to monitor for any bugs or user feedback. Future work could involve considering potential enhancements such as custom sound support or analytics, but no new development is actively in progress.
