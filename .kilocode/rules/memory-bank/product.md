# Product Vision: Sharp Timer

## The Problem

In a world full of distractions, maintaining focus is a significant challenge. Many productivity tools are feature-heavy, intrusive, and contribute to the very digital noise they claim to reduce. Users need a simple, effective timer that helps them manage their work and rest intervals without adding complexity to their workflow.

## The Solution: Sharp Timer

Sharp Timer is a minimalist macOS timer application that lives exclusively in the menu bar. It is designed to be an unobtrusive yet powerful tool for anyone practicing time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique.

The core philosophy is **distraction-free productivity**. It never appears in the dock, it doesn't have a complex UI, and it seamlessly integrates into the macOS environment.

## How It Works

Sharp Timer provides three customizable timer modes:
- **Work Mode**: For focused work sessions.
- **Rest Your Eyes Mode**: For short breaks to prevent eye strain.
- **Long Rest Mode**: For longer breaks to recharge.

The application intelligently automates the workflow. When a "Work" timer completes, it automatically transitions to a "Rest Your Eyes" timer in a paused state, allowing the user to begin their break with a single click. This seamless flow encourages consistent work-break cycles, enhancing productivity and well-being.

## Key Features & User Experience Goals

- **Menu Bar Exclusivity**: The application is always accessible but never in the way. This respects the user's screen real estate and focus.
- **Simplicity**: The interface is clean and intuitive. All primary actions are a single click away.
- **Customization**: While it works out of the box with sensible defaults, users can tailor the duration of each timer mode to fit their personal workflow.
- **Persistence**: The timer's state is saved, even if the user quits the application or the system sleeps. This provides a reliable and consistent experience.
- **Intelligent Automation**: Automatic mode switching removes the manual effort of managing work/break cycles, making the process frictionless.
- **Native Experience**: The application looks and feels like a native part of macOS, using system notifications and respecting system-wide settings.
